Cellular Network Coverage Analysis
Project Description
This project involves developing a Python program to analyze and visualize cellular network coverage from JSON data. The program processes data for base stations, antennas, and their coverage areas, and provides a user-friendly command-line interface for various statistics and coverage checks.

Features
Data Processing: Efficiently analyzed base stations, antennas, and coverage areas from JSON data.
Command-Line Interface: Implemented a menu with options for global statistics, base station statistics, and coverage checks.
Statistical Analysis: Calculated comprehensive statistics including the total number of base stations, antennas, and detailed coverage information.
Coverage Verification: Verified if specific coordinates are covered and identified the nearest antennas along with received power information.
